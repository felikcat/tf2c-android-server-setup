. https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/[MobaXterm] is used to access the VPS and has drag and drop functionality (FTP/SFTP support). On other operating systems that aren't Windows, you can replicate this functionality by using https://filezilla-project.org/[FileZilla].

. Login under the user account you made for hosting this server, such as `# useradd hosting`. Do not run the server as root (#)!

. Install the following on the VPS (Debian): +
`# add-apt-repository multiverse; dpkg --add-architecture i386; apt update` +
`# apt install steamcmd`

. Download the Server from the *#installation* section of the https://discord.com/invite/gXaxjbdNs5[TF2Classic: Android Community Server]; you need https://discord.com/[Discord] for this step to access the text channel.

. Copy that zip from your PC over to the VPS, then extract what that zip is called, which in my case was: +
`$ unzip linserver-tf2classic-source-engine-17b06224.zip`

. In *#installation*, under TF2Classic Resources click "Download Resources", right-click on the Download button to "Copy Link", then feed that link into your VPS: +
`wget https://cloud.tyabus.co.uk/s/KGsMW9NxpNKyGrk/download/EXAMPLE_ONLY_DONT_USE.7z`

. Extract the 7z you downloaded: +
`7zz x tf2classic.7z`

. Move the extracted contents to the correct directory: +
`mv tf2classic/* game_tf2classic_dedicated/tf2classic`

. Get a legal copy of Half-Life 2, or download TF2 to get the folders "hl2" and "platform". Then, compress those two folders: +

image:explorer_dz8Ap15x1l.png[]

. Extract those HL2 files, or TF2's depending on what route you took: +
`7zz x "Half-Life 2.7z"`

. Running the server: +
`./game_tf2classic_dedicated/srcds_linux -console -game tf2classic/ +map ctf_2fort +maxplayers 24`
