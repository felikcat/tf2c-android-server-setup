== Setting up the game server files

NOTE: This tutorial is for systemd Linux distros such as Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, or Fedora. If you have solutions for non-systemd distros, mention them to me in an issue and I'll test them out and add them here.

. https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/[MobaXterm] is used to access the server and has drag and drop functionality (FTP/SFTP support). Alternatively you can replicate the drag and drop functionality by using https://filezilla-project.org/[FileZilla]. 

. To get all the required system dependencies for hosting a TF2C Android server, https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux[install SteamCMD on the server], then install `screen` for your distribution.

. Login under the user account you made for hosting this server, such as "hosting" (`# useradd -m -G users -s /bin/bash hosting`). Do not run the server as root (#)!
- And ensure you are inside the home folder of your user, such as `/home/hosting`.

. Download the Server from the *#installation* section of the https://discord.com/invite/gXaxjbdNs5[TF2Classic: Android Community Server]; you need https://discord.com/[Discord] for this step to access the text channel.

. Copy that zip from your PC over to the server, then extract what that zip is called, which in my case was: +
`$ unzip linserver-tf2classic-source-engine-17b06224.zip`

. In *#installation*, under TF2Classic Resources click "Download Resources", right-click on the Download button to "Copy Link", then feed that link into your server: +
`$ wget https://cloud.tyabus.co.uk/s/KGsMW9NxpNKyGrk/download/EXAMPLE_ONLY_DONT_USE.7z`

. Extract the 7z you downloaded: +
`$ 7zz x tf2classic.7z`

. Move the extracted contents to the correct directory: +
`$ mv tf2classic/* game_tf2classic_dedicated/tf2classic`

. Get a legal copy of Half-Life 2, or download TF2 to get the folders "hl2" and "platform". Then, compress those two folders: +
image:explorer_iNQX4Y5pu8.png[] +
image:explorer_dz8Ap15x1l.png[]

. Extract those HL2 files, or TF2's depending on what route you took: +
`$ cd ${HOME}/game_tf2classic_dedicated` +
`$ 7zz x "Half-Life 2.7z"`

== Configuring the TF2C Android server
* Inside `${HOME}/game_tf2classic_dedicated/tf2classic` is a folder called `cfg`. This is where you will create or edit `server.cfg`, with the following contents:
[source,sh]
----
hostname "Your server name here"
sv_password ""
sv_lan 0

// Remote CONtrol; granting you the ability to run commands on the server while running.
rcon_password "Change me to something secure!"

// Ban a user from RCON after giving a wrong password 5 times, for 1440 minutes.
sv_rcon_maxfailures 5
sv_rcon_banpenalty 1440

// Both teams can talk to each other through voice chat.
sv_alltalk 1

// Useful for keeping track of players, any server crashes, so on.
log on
sv_logbans 1

// Time limit until a map change.
mp_timelimit 30

// Less delay than 20 tick. This is more CPU taxing on the server if a player is above 20FPS.
sv_minupdaterate 30
sv_mincmdrate 30

// 100 updaterate in 32-bit TF2 causes precision/timing issues; should also apply to TF2C Android.
sv_maxupdaterate 66
sv_maxcmdrate 66
----

== Running the server as a system service

NOTE: - If you wish to host a hidden server, add `-nomaster`. +
- You do not need `+servercfgfile` and `+mapcyclefile` unless you are hosting multiple servers.

* Edit as NON-root (the 'hosting' account as an example): `${HOME}/game_tf2classic_dedicated/run_dm.sh`
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/sh

screen -dmS "tf2c-android-dm" ./srcds_linux -console -game tf2classic +map dm_2fort +servercfgfile "server_dm.cfg" +mapcyclefile "mapcycle_dm.txt"
----

* Login as root, then edit: `/etc/systemd/system/tf2c-android-dm.service`
[source,sh]
----
[Unit]
Description=TF2C Android Deathmatch
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
# The SHell script forks off into our desired process.
Type=forking

# Ensure to set the correct user and working directory (installation directory of your server) here.
User=hosting
WorkingDirectory=/home/hosting/game_tf2classic_dedicated

ExecStart=/usr/bin/sh run_dm.sh

# Restart the server when it is stopped or crashed after 30 seconds.
# Comment out RestartSec if you want to restart immediately.
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

StandardInput=null

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

* Enable then start the server: +
`# systemctl enable --now tf2c-android-dm`

NOTE: If your server doesn't start up, you might have the wrong permissions. +
Running this as root `chown hosting:hosting run_dm.sh` will correct that, given that `run_dm.sh` is in your current directory. +
If not, just put the full path to it, such as `chown hosting:hosting /home/hosting/game_tf2classic_dedicated/run_dm.sh`

== How to monitor your servers afterwards

. List the available screen sessions: +
`$ screen -ls`

. Let's say there's a screen on "tf2c-android-dm", you'd do the following to attach to it: +
`$ screen -r tf2c-android-dm`

. Hit kbd:[Ctrl + a] then kbd:[d] to detach from the screen session; this will not close it, which is good.

. For other usage tips on Screen, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNU_Screen[Arch Linux's wiki page] on it.


== Other information
* Server logs are stored at: `${HOME}/game_tf2classic_dedicated/tf2classic/logs`

* To see systemd's messages for the service: `journalctl -fu tf2c-android-dm`
