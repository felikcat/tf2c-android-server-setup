. https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/[MobaXterm] is used to access the server and has drag and drop functionality (FTP/SFTP support). On other operating systems that aren't Windows, you can replicate this functionality by using https://filezilla-project.org/[FileZilla].

. https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#Linux[Install SteamCMD on the server] to get all the required system dependencies for hosting a TF2C Android server.

. Login under the user account you made for hosting this server, such as "hosting" (`# useradd -m -G users -s /bin/bash hosting`). Do not run the server as root (#)!
- And ensure you are inside the home folder of your user, such as `/home/hosting`.

. Download the Server from the *#installation* section of the https://discord.com/invite/gXaxjbdNs5[TF2Classic: Android Community Server]; you need https://discord.com/[Discord] for this step to access the text channel.

. Copy that zip from your PC over to the server, then extract what that zip is called, which in my case was: +
`$ unzip linserver-tf2classic-source-engine-17b06224.zip`

. In *#installation*, under TF2Classic Resources click "Download Resources", right-click on the Download button to "Copy Link", then feed that link into your server: +
`$ wget https://cloud.tyabus.co.uk/s/KGsMW9NxpNKyGrk/download/EXAMPLE_ONLY_DONT_USE.7z`

. Extract the 7z you downloaded: +
`$ 7zz x tf2classic.7z`

. Move the extracted contents to the correct directory: +
`$ mv tf2classic/* game_tf2classic_dedicated/tf2classic`

. Get a legal copy of Half-Life 2, or download TF2 to get the folders "hl2" and "platform". Then, compress those two folders: +
image:explorer_iNQX4Y5pu8.png[] +
image:explorer_dz8Ap15x1l.png[]

. Extract those HL2 files, or TF2's depending on what route you took: +
`$ cd ${HOME}/game_tf2classic_dedicated` +
`$ 7zz x "Half-Life 2.7z"`

. Running the server (must be inside the "game_tf2classic_dedicated" directory): +
`$ ./srcds_linux -console -game tf2classic +map ctf_2fort +maxplayers 24`

NOTE: Doing `-game tf2classic/` will break listing to the master server, which is where other players can Find Servers. +
If you wish to host a hidden server, run with `-nomaster` instead.
