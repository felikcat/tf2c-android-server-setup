. https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/[MobaXterm] is used to access the VPS and has drag and drop functionality (FTP/SFTP support). On other operating systems that aren't Windows, you can replicate this functionality by using https://filezilla-project.org/[FileZilla].

. Download the Server from the #installation section of the https://discord.com/invite/gXaxjbdNs5[TF2Classic: Android Community Server]; you need https://discord.com/[Discord] for this step to access the text channel.

. Extract what that zip is called, which in my case was: +
`unzip linserver-tf2classic-source-engine-17b06224.zip`

. In #installation, under TF2Classic Resources click "Download Resources", right-click on the Download button to "Copy Link", so we can feed it into the VPS as follows: +
`wget https://cloud.tyabus.co.uk/s/KGsMW9NxpNKyGrk/download/EXAMPLE_ONLY_DONT_USE.7z` +
`7zz x tf2classic.7z`

. `mv tf2classic/* game_tf2classic_dedicated/tf2classic`

. Get a legal copy of Half-Life 2, or download TF2 to get the folders "hl2" and "platform". Then, compress those two folders: +
